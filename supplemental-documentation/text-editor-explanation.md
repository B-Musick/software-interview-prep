# Text Editor Explanation

VS CODE!?!?! Flame war commence!!!! I know, I know. There are a million different options here, and we can argue forever about the "Best" editor (spoiler: There isn't one), but we're making the call here to use Visual Studio Code because VIM isn't approachable, most other options are too heavy or not free, and VS Code is what the person writing this guide had on their computer. If you're comfortable with something else, feel free to use something else, but here, we are making this decision under the "Approachability Guideline" of "sacrifice development speed, performance, and productivity every time if it makes the code easier for those with less technical expertise to participate in the project." The easiest thing here is to just pick one and not present first-time contributors an overwhelming number of options that could paralyze them. 

If you would like to rewrite this section in another free, simple, light-weight IDE (like Atom) we would be willing to include it as supplemental material.

All of that said, as much as possible, Approachable IO attempts to be IDE agnostic, and we are open to feedback.
