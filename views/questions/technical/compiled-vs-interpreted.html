		A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code).
		For example, an addition "+" operation in your source code could be translated directly to the "ADD" instruction in machine code.
		<br/>
		An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines already compiled into machine code.
		For example, the same "+" operation would be recognised by the interpreter at run time, which would then call its own "add(a,b)" function with the appropriate arguments, which would then execute the machine code "ADD" instruction.

		Example of compiled language is Fortran, c, c++, etc.
		<br/>
		Example of interpreted language is perl, php, etc.
