        <p>What is a CDN and what advantages or disadvantages does it have?</p>
        <p>
	  A content delivery network, also known as a CDN, transparently connects users with web content. Rather than retrieving information from just one central server, CDNs feature multiple servers that are spread out geographically. Whichever server is physically closest to the user will deliver the content. Each server, or point of presence (PoP), stores an identical copy of data so it is ready for transfer.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are several advantages to using CDNs. Distributing service spatially increases content availability and improves speed and performance. Applications using CDNs can better protect against hackers, spammers, and other security threats. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  CDNs also come with some disadvantages. For one, they incur extra cost. They make website deployment more complicated. And depending on where users are geographically, servers may not actually get the content closer to them.
