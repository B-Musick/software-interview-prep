# software-interview-prep
Approachable IO website to help those prepping for interviewing while allowing anyone to practice their skills by making Pull Requests.

## Contribute an interview question
If you're a Git/Github expert, feel free to skip some sections. If you have never made a Pull Request before, check out our [getting-started](https://github.com/approachable-io/getting-started) guide which will show you how to create your Github account and make your first Open Source contribution. The following guide assumes you have already taken those steps. If you have that down, let's jump into sharing your interview question!

### Install Git
Here is a detailed explanation of [how to install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Make a fork of the project
A fork is a copy of a project. In this case, you will be copying the project [software-interview-prep](https://github.com/approachable-io/software-interview-prep), making a change to that copy, and then making a Pull Request - a request for the original product to incorporate your changes.

Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner of the screen to fork the repository.

If everything goes smoothly it should look like this for a few seconds

And then it should look like this ![After Fork Screen](images/after-fork-screen.png)

The difference between the repository you started with and this new repository is that your username should appear in the top left. If your username is `grace-hopper`, it should say something like `grace-hopper / software-interview-prep` and the line below it should read `forked from approachable-io / software-interview-prep`.
